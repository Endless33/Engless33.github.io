# VRP Protocol / Jumping VPN  
A living protocol architecture for secure, adaptive communication.

VRP (Variable Routing Protocol) and Jumping VPN form a dual‑layer communication model:
- Jumping VPN provides the encrypted transport perimeter.
- VRP operates inside it as a behavioral, adaptive protocol with organism‑like session dynamics.

This repository hosts the minimal public surface of the project.

## Whitepaper v0.1

The whitepaper describes:
- cryptographic foundation  
- behavioral model  
- transport abstraction  
- data channel  
- server architecture  
- security model  

A public version will be added here when ready.

## Why This Matters

Secure communication is no longer defined only by encryption strength.  
It requires adaptability, behavior, and resilience under observation.

VRP explores a dynamic model where a protocol behaves more like an organism than a static tunnel — capable of evolving, rotating, and adapting to network conditions.

## Observer Map

The project has attracted attention from engineers and analysts across:
- cloud hyperscalers  
- intelligence and defense units  
- national CERT/CSIRT teams  
- satellite & space‑tech communications  
- quantum‑resistant cryptography research  
- Fortune‑500 security divisions  
- senior infrastructure architects at major hardware and networking companies  

This list is documented as part of the protocol’s evolution.

## Community

A minimal discussion channel will be added soon.  
For now, updates are published on LinkedIn.

## Support the Project

VRP / Jumping VPN is an independent, self‑funded research effort.  
Support options will be added here once the public site is online.
